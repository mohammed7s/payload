Landing page (Connect app, docs, github) links

App: 

Two distinct views. Distinct design. Clear switching between the two views. 


Employer view: 

burger menu on the left for employer (dashboard, employee management, compliance, reports) 
Dashboard: 
- section1: balances (Etheruem balance) + (Shielded Balance) 
- Section2: table for employees (name, 0zk address, salary)
- Section3:  widget for processing(Step1: shield, step2: transfer payroll) and we want to choose the token we want to send (usdc, or pyusd)


Design principles: 

- Cypherpunk/code font. Soft. 
- Minimal black and white. Clean.
